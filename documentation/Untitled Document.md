**Entity:** 
“Me Deixe” System

**Background:** 
The urgent need for an additional technological solution directly integrated with law enforcement agencies to combat and prevent violence against women in the state of Sergipe. 

**Purpose:** 
To develop the "Me Deixe" System, a technological solution designed to address the needs of combating domestic violence in the semi-arid region of Sergipe, Brazil. Employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates knowledge from information technology, human rights, and social work, the "Me Deixe" System aims to provide female victims of violence with an effective and accessible tool to seek help, protect their safety, and pursue justice. To develop a solution grounded in robust software architecture principles tailored for social technologies, prioritizing robustness, effectiveness, and accessibility.  

**Scope:** 
Initially, two applications will be needed: a mobile application for use by victims and a web application for use by the police. The mobile application with a basic interface for making calls and the web application for listing and managing emergency calls made by victims.

**Objectives:**
- Design a user-friendly interface for browsing victims calls and managing calls.
- Serving the Alto-Sertão region of Sergipe
- Ensure the app runs smoothly on different mobile devices.
- Achieve a rating of 4 stars or higher on app stores within the first month.

**Approach:**
1. Evaluation and Selection:
    * We will evaluate existing architecture frameworks (e.g., TOGAF, Zachman Framework) based on their suitability for the project's complexity and domain.
    * We will assess available architecture elaboration techniques (e.g., workshops, scenario modeling) and identify the most efficient methods for gathering requirements and defining the architecture.
    * We will review pre-defined architecture viewpoints, modeling templates, and view generation methods to ensure they capture the necessary information for stakeholders.
    * If existing options are not ideal, we will consider developing or modifying frameworks, templates, and methods to suit the project's specific needs. This should be done with justification and documented for future reference.

2. Tailored Architecture Definition:
    * The chosen framework will be used as a foundation, but we will have the flexibility to adapt it to the project's specific requirements.
    * We will select appropriate viewpoints (e.g., functional, data) to document the architecture from different perspectives, ensuring all stakeholders have a clear understanding.
    * We will leverage existing modeling templates or develop customized ones to capture the necessary details of the architecture components, their interactions, and data flows.
    * View generation methods will be chosen based on their effectiveness in communicating the architecture to different audiences (e.g., diagrams for technical teams, narrative descriptions for stakeholders).

3. Documentation and Communication:
    * The architecture will be comprehensively documented, including decisions made, justification for choices, and a clear traceability matrix linking requirements to architecture components.
    * We will utilize appropriate tools for documenting the architecture, potentially leveraging existing enterprise architecture tools or collaborative platforms depending on governance guidelines.
    * Effective communication strategies will be employed to present the architecture to stakeholders. This might involve workshops, presentations, and interactive visualizations to ensure understanding and buy-in.

4. Continuous Improvement:
    * We will adopt an iterative approach to architecture elaboration, allowing for refinements based on stakeholder feedback or changing project requirements.
    * The chosen architecture approach will be reviewed and assessed after project completion to identify areas for improvement for future projects.

**Schedule:**

        + Identify major architectural components and their interactions.
- Week 5-6: Technology Stack Selection and Integration Strategy (Milestone 3: Technology Stack Defined)
    - Activities:
        + Identify specific technologies (e.g., databases, programming languages) that align with the chosen framework and project requirements.
        + Define a strategy for integrating third-party APIs and external systems.
        + Consider infrastructure needs (e.g., cloud deployment) and security implications.
- Week 7-8: Detailed Architecture Design and Refinement (Milestone 4: Detailed Architecture Defined)
    - Activities:
